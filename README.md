### The main issue with this challenge was to work out whether to do a "Complete" solution that gives BOTH rates at the same time or the option to pick which rate card to use first and then follow that pricing route.

### I decided to go for the latter as for rate card "B" there are additional parameters that need to be included before you can make final calculations. 

### Hopefully the solution presented is what was required. 

### One thing I did ralise after submission is I am missing a check on card B. When submitting the distances of each pot from the cabinet it would be prudent to ensure that the number of distances matches the number of pots being installed. Currently the program just accepts however many distances you supply without checking this matches. Will correct this in a later iteration.
